### 【2013.07 - 2014.12】 A financial regulatory reporting system for an overseas branch of a commercial bank

+ Data Warehouse

```
This project is the construction of a regulatory reporting data warehouse for an overseas branch of a large China commercial bank located in Europe. It is capable of generating regulatory reporting data files in accordance with the data and format requirements of the local regulatory authorities. It also produces various types of user reports in a fixed format for the branch's customers and provides internal analysis reports for the branch's business departments.

I participated in the complete process of this project, from requirement analysis to deployment and maintenance. The tasks that I was responsible for include:

1. During the requirements analysis phase, I assisted the project manager in communicating with the business department, clarifying requirements, planning metadata, and participating in the compilation of all project documents.
2. During the development and testing phase, I designed table structures and data processing programs, and completed the development and testing work.
3. During the deployment and implementation phase, I independently supported the deployment of project versions at the data center site, and developed and implemented data backup strategies for operations engineers.
4. During the maintenance phase, I provided remote technical support services.


In the project, our data team discovered that the structure of the backend data of the Murex system used by the overseas branch is significantly different from the structure of other systems in the bank, requiring a lot of integration work. In addition, the overseas branch has many business types that are not found domestically, making the logic of handling bank transactions more complex than before. Through the collective efforts of me and my team colleagues, we clarified the conversion processing rules for the business areas of concern to the overseas branch before the first phase of SIT testing in the project, and clearly defined the scope of requirements. We performed multiple processes on the backend data of their purchased funds processing system, ultimately enabling the smooth integration of regulatory reporting data for this business area and meeting the calculation requirements of all related reports. Our technical capabilities and data quality have been recognized by the overseas branch.

During the project deployment phase, I, as a representative of the data development team, participated in the deployment process at the headquarters' Beijing data center along with the entire development team from Shenzhen. During the system rollout by the headquarters' operations team, there was an issue with the production environment that caused the related batch scheduling system to fail to start smoothly. As the only member of the data development team present at the scene, under the pressure of approaching deployment time and the presence of the headquarters' team leaders, I successfully analyzed and identified the cause of the problem and promptly resolved it, ensuring the timely and normal operation of the system.
