###  【Aug 2016 - Jan 2019】  Manage Production OLTP databases

+ PostgreSQL | Alibaba Cloud

```
This project serves as the online database for the company's core product, "X志愿" and is deployed on Alibaba Cloud. It reliably supports the data management needs of the product.
``` 

My responsibilities in this project included:

1. Responsible for the design, implementation, daily operation, configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting of the database system architecture across all environments, including development, testing, and production. In charge of monitoring backup status, developing recovery strategy plans, and creating and executing data backup and recovery plans.
2. In charge of database performance monitoring and tuning, promptly identifying issues and optimizing the way the backend accesses the database, as well as addressing poorly performing SQL queries.
3. Responsible for the logical structure design of databases in projects. This involves analyzing business requirements, designing, reviewing, and creating database objects, as well as maintaining them.
4. Generate and update core datasets required by products in bulk based on business needs, ensuring their quality is maintained.
5. Quickly locate and resolve database-related faults and performance issues.


"X志愿" is one of the company's core data products. It relies on historical enrollment data from colleges and universities nationwide, combined with AI algorithms, to predict the current year's admission outcomes for target school majors based on the personal circumstances of college entrance exam candidates. It provides intelligent and personalized advice for filling out volunteer applications. The company is one of only three volunteer application service providers in the Baidu App nationwide.

The company uses Alibaba Cloud as its cloud service provider, and all production environments are deployed on Alibaba Cloud. I am fully responsible for the design and implementation of the database architecture for this product.

After evaluating the performance and stability of Alibaba Cloud RDS, the company considered various factors such as price, data access characteristics of the "X志愿" product, and the overall product's requirements for database performance and stability. As a result, the decision was made to build a production database cluster based on PostgreSQL on ECS. I designed and implemented the database cluster architecture solution, which has been operating stably without any failures throughout the year. Compared to the previous generation of MongoDB-based database solutions, the new cluster offers significant improvements in read/write performance, development flexibility, feature richness, efficiency of batch data updates, and service stability. I have also automated the backup strategy implementation for this cluster, ensuring the security of product data.

The access to the database by the business system and the growth of basic business data experience a significant surge during the period around the college entrance exams every year, while the workload remains relatively stable during other periods. Investing resources to handle such peak access at all times would undoubtedly be a huge waste. Therefore, I have designed a solution that allows the cluster to smoothly scale up and down before and after business peak periods. During peak hours, the cluster stably supports approximately 8k TPS, while outside of peak hours, it efficiently supports the business in a cost-effective manner.
