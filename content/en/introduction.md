I have many years of professional experience in data development, familiar with the entire data processing process, including data cleaning, data storage, and solving various data problems (data backlog, data delay, data transmission efficiency, etc.). My main work areas include the design and implementation of enterprise data warehouses, ETL pipelines of massive data, design and construction of data processing platforms, design, implementation and maintenance of OLTP database architectures, SQL performance tuning, etc. I efficiently collaborate and coordinate in projects. I have designed and implemented complete data warehouse projects for a china large commercial bank, as well as implemented Big Data solutions for Internet companies.

The industries I have worked in include traditional IT, Internet, and AI companies. I prefer working with teams that are rigorous and practical. I hope to join a company that has long-term business development plans and is committed to creating continuous value for society.
